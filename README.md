# Online-course-website

#### Background

This online-course-website will be developed as a project for the course Tietokanta Sovellus at University of Helsinki. The idea is to build a project that focuses on website development that makes use of databases. I will use the PostgreSQL database management system and Python's Flask library to build the project. The course is worth 4 study points. Here is a link to the University of Helsinki course webpage: ![Tietokanta Sovellus](https://hy-tsoha.github.io/materiaali/)
