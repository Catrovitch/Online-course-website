# Online-course-website

#### Background

This online-course-website will be developed as a project for the course Tietokanta Sovellus at University of Helsinki. The idea of the course is to build a project that focuses on website development that makes use of databases. I will use the PostgreSQL database management system and Python's Flask library to build the project. In the course material for the course Tietokanta Sovellus there where some proposed example subjects and I have chosen to focus my project on the proposed subject of a website for online courses. I have chosen to do this subject since I have very limited experience in web development and choosing this subject seemed like a solid choice for me to develop a project while at the same time learning about webdevelopment. The course Tietokanta Sovellus is worth 4 study points. Here is a link to the University of Helsinki course webpage: [Tietokanta Sovellus](https://hy-tsoha.github.io/materiaali/).

## Description of Program

I will be developing an online-course-website which can be used to set up various online courses. The program will contain both text based material and exercises of various nature. All users will be either a teacher (administrator) or a student (normal user). 

##### Some functionalities of the program:

- A student can: 
  - Create an account of student status.
  - Log in to the service.
  - See what courses are available.
  - Apply for a course.
  - Read the course material.
  - Do course exercises.
  - Review statistics about course progression.

- A teacher can:
  - Create a new course.
  - Change course material.
  - Delete a course.
  - Add more exercises to a course.
  - Track what student is on what course, as well as their progression.
 
 The exercises will consist of automatically checked exercises that are either text based or multiple-choice-questions. 
  - A text based question could be:
    - How many legs does an insect have? (give your answer in non-capital letters)
      - Correct answer: "six"
  - A multiple-choice-question could be:
    - Choose the correct alternative:
      - An insect has eight legs
      - An insect has two-and-a-half leg
      - An insect has six legs
      
      Comment: There would be a checkboxed at the right side of each alternative choice.
